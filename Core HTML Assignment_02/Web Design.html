    <P> <b> What is Web Designing? </b>
        <br>
        <br>
          Web designing is the process of planning, conceptualizing, and implementing the plan for designing 
          a website in a way that is functional and offers a good user experience. User experience is central
          to the web designing process. Websites have an array of elements presented in ways that make them 
          easy to navigate. Web designing essentially involves working on every attribute of the website that
          people interact with, so that the website is simple and efficient, allows users to quickly find the 
          information they need, and looks visually pleasing. All these factors, when combined, decide how
          well the website is designed.
